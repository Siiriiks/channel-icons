# Contributing

The best way to contribute is to simply [make an issue](https://github.com/v-briese/channel-icons/issues/new/choose) and fill in the necessary information for the selected template.

If instead of [creating an issue](https://github.com/v-briese/channel-icons/issues/new/choose) you decide to open a pull request, please **modify only the `source.scss` file** (unless bumping the version). Before opening a PR, make sure you compile your changes by running `npm run compile`. (You may also run `npm run watch` before making any changes to automatically compile every time you save.) Icons should be made in 24 x 24 containers.

Be fully prepared for any submitted pull requests to be heavily critiqued or denied. If I think any icons you add or change are out of place or plain ugly, I will deny your pull request. If you failed to format your code to my liking, I will try my best to work with you to fix it.

**Thank you for your contribution!**
